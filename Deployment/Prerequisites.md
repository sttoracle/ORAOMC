# OMC Deployment pre-requsites

Here is the recommended deployment architecture for OMC

![](images/deployment-architecture.png)

## A. Gateway RequirementsGateway is an optional component. However, Oracle recommends using a Gateway agent to limit access to internet. OMC gateway and agents use pull mechanism for all requests direct or via proxy

#### Recommended Sizing for the server running Gateway -

1. Memory:  8g RAM, 1g heap, Disk:  50g for small (< 100 entities), 100g+ for more
2. Up to 2000 agents to one gateway, or can use multiple for HA
3. Recommend standalone vm or host to isolate network and activity



## B. Cloud Agent Requirements
Need to be deployed on all hosts or VMs to collect metric or log data
1. Install on a separate file system or mountpoint to avoid conflict with other products

2. Memory: 4g RAM, .5g Heap; Disk: 10g for agent install

3. Installation user
	- must have read access to files required for Log Analytics
	- set hard nofile 65536; max user processes >=4000


## C. Network Requirements

<blockquote>
<b>Note:</b><br>
Typically opening port is SLA-bound and might take time for necessary request and approval process.<br> 
Create the OMC instance and obtain the IP address as a first step, since port opening request will require the IP address of the instance.
</blockquote>

#### When using Gateway

1. From Gateway to [OMC instance](https://<tenanid>.itom.management.us2.oraclecloud.com/*): permit outbound communication over (https/443) - directly or via proxy
	- IP address of the OMC instance can be determined by looking up hostname from the administraJon page of OMC console (`Administration` -> `Agents` ->`Download` Tab) and then simple OS level command such as nslookup to find the IP address associated with the hostname of the OMC instance. 

2. Cloud Agent to Gateway: permit outbound communication over https/(4459 to 4479)
	- These ports need to be opened only internally and not towards public internet

#### Without Gateway

1. Cloud agent host to [OMC instance](https://<tenanid>.itom.management.us2.oraclecloud.com/*):Â permit outbound communication over (https/443) - directly or via proxy

	- IP address of the OMC instance can be determined by looking up hostname from the administration page of OMC console (Administration -> Agents ->Download Tab) and then simple OS level command such as nslookup to find the IP address associated with the hostname of the OMC instance. 


#### Optional proxy requirements
Host, port, authentication if required
